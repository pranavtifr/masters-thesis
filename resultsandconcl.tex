\chapter{ Conclusions}
\label{conc}
      To summarize, We know that doing foreground clustering using a single measure already
performed on par with the Planck collaboration's pipelines \cite{datarishi}.
We see now that the various machine learning algorithms used for this improves upon the FC-ILC
algorithm using a single measure. 
We also see that, using unsupervised machine learning, we 
perform better than the models based methods \cite{lilrishi} 
too. 
We hope that using a independent algorithm to produce maps with
different residuals, would be useful in testing for the effect of foregrounds and any biases in
the existing algorithms for the estimates of the cosmological parameters. 
We also showed that, the different map generated doesn't have 
an effect on the cross correlation showing that it is a 
systematic deviation which is uncorrelated with the signal.We 
hope that this systematic deviation would help explain the 
difference between Planck cosmology and WMAP cosmology.
